We are working with the city of Louisville and local developers to recreate all of Louisville in Minecraft at 1:1!

Work started on the project during our [National Day of Civic Hacking](http://blog.yourmapper.com/2014/06/hack-for-change-louisville-recap-2014/) event.

Since then we are working out the logistics and technical details of how to take raw GIS data and automatically create a Minecraft world with it.  Get started yourself and check out our [resources and progress](https://hackpad.com/Minecraft-Louisville-Ub1wrkuQJ2a).

**Updates**

One of our volunteers Dannie Gregoire is building a custom GIS->DB->Minecraft system called *Slarty*.  Read more at [Minecraft Louisville](http://www.minecraftlouisville.com/).  

Some technical details include:

- 2 billion surface blocks
- 500 billion cubic blocks
- 800GB of RAM to load it all at once
