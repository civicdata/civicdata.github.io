# Community IoT Hackathon at the Gigabit Experience Center
Join the [Civic Data Alliance](http://www.civicdataalliance.org/), [Metro Louisville's OPI2](https://louisvilleky.gov/government/performance-improvement-innovation) and [LVL1](http://www.lvl1.org/) along with _Amazon_ and _Microsoft_ for an IoT Hackathon at the Gigabit Experience Center, located in the Louisville Central Community Center.

This event's focus will be on the Internet of Things, and how they connect to and impact our lives as citizens.

__Who should get involved?__  Urbanists, civic hackers, government staff, developers, designers, community organizers, and anyone with the passion for making their city better.

__SKILLS:__ Projects might include any of the following skills, so you can always be a help:

Research (web/email/phone), idea focus, data entry, modifying existing code, using 3rd party online services, graphic design, user experience (UX), documentation, presentation creation, mapping, and/or data analysis!  

__WHAT TO BRING:__ Your laptop, power cables, software, smartphones, chargers, monitors, mice, ideas, and self.

__HOW TO PREPARE:__ Though we will be working together to build actual skills and apps for IoT during the event, if you are non-technical, we still need your help.  

During the event entrepreneurs, marketing, designers, and regular citizens can help steer the direction of the project, explore great ideas, and work on the presentation in order to communicate the idea clearly. Plus there is always data to munge.
