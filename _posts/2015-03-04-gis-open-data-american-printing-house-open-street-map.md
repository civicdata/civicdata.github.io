# Helping the Visually Impaired Navigate Louisville Using Open Data
The CDA hosted two [CodeAcross 2015](http://www.codeforamerica.org/events/codeacross-2015/) events in Louisville on [February 21](http://www.meetup.com/Louisville-Civic-Data-Alliance/events/219829803/) and [March 21](http://www.meetup.com/Louisville-Civic-Data-Alliance/events/220786152/). Dedicated volunteers converged on the  Urban Design Studio and the American Printing House for the Blind for two days of OpenStreetMap learning and editing, in support of the American Printing House for the Blind’s ‘Nearby Explorer’ app.  [Nearby Explorer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.aph.avigenie) is an advanced GPS solution recently released for Android smartphones by the American Printing House for the blind. The app gives the visually impaired and the blind audible cues about their immediate surroundings, and directions to places they would like to go.

During CodeAcross, The Civic Data Alliance took newly open GIS data (precise locations of buildings and address information) from the city of Louisville and [organized](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky/Building_Outlines_Import/Contributor_Guide) volunteers to load it into Open Street Map so the American Printing House can use it to improve Nearby Explorer.

[![OSM Building Import Progress](/images/screenshot-building-editing.jpg)](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky/Building_Outlines_Import/Contributor_Guide)

We taught volunteers how to use OSM's [Task Manager](http://tasks.openstreetmap.us/job/50) to load buildings and addresses, one neighborhood at a time, and made initial progress toward adding the data for the entire city into OpenStreetMap. There is still a lot of work to be done to get all the buildings and addresses loaded, so please join us for Part 2 of the effort Saturday, March 21st at the American Printing House for the Blind.

For this event there was actually zero programming needed.  All that was needed is a laptop, following written and spoken instructions, and an attention to detail.  Any other skills are just a bonus.  It was a great way to build our brigade with some prep work by our leaders.

**Outcomes**

Between February 16 and May 15, 20+ people have collaboratively worked on over 550 areas of the city, for an estimated 410+ hours of work.  We are now finished!

*"This is simply amazing that it shows up so quickly.   I am amazed to see the power of CDA and what a group of dedicated people can actually accomplish. It is amazing how much actually got done in one day. We can easily tell!"* - Larry at APH

*"I'm amazed! I was testing on a bus around the time the CDA added the data north of Brownsboro Rd, and when it showed up, I thought I was running the wrong build of our app. Should have checked my email before trying to confirm I was running the right build!"* - Rob at APH

We also had some massive help from an expert OSM editor named [Sam Wallingford](http://www.openstreetmap.org/user/Omnific), an engineering student at UVa.  He started work in April and over the next month completed [more areas](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hvd-Ix42pkISHrbU6zZ0Be-PvggtBFa9VvNDHWvyhF0/edit#gid=0) than everyone else combined.  Thanks so much Sam!

The CDA is looking at helping other brigades import their data, and may run a workshop at the [Code for America Summit](http://www.codeforamerica.org/summit/) this September.  We are also prepping other city data to load, including parks and natural areas, streams, alleys, cemeteries, parking, and historic markers.  We will continue to push the city to release more data to load, like traffic signs, traffic signals, 1-foot contours, parcels, and impervious surfaces.

**CDA Work Before the Event**

The core CDA put in about 140 volunteer hours to prep for the project and event. Here's what we did. If your brigade were to do it, it would likely take 40 hours of prep with our guidance (please contact us for help!).

1. Identify the need from APH during our December meetup.
2. Work with LOJIC and Metro Louisville to add an appropriate open data license to [portal](http://portal.louisvilleky.gov/content/terms-use-accessibility-data-policy) and [FTP](ftp://ftp.lojic.org/pub/federal/) site.
3. Work with the OSM import community [mailing](https://lists.openstreetmap.org/listinfo/imports) [lists](https://lists.openstreetmap.org/listinfo/imports-us) to get approval for our import.
4. Create [OSM Wiki pages](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky/Building_Outlines_Import) that show [qualitative](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky/Building_Outlines_Import/OSMvsGISOverlapExamples) and [quantitative](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky/Building_Outlines_Import#Building_Outlines) data analysis, tagging, reconciliation plan, and user accounts process.
5. Research the best methods for importing data [properly](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Import/Guidelines) into OSM: [JOSM](https://josm.openstreetmap.de/), Task Manager.
6. Write a step-by-step [Contributor Guide](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky/Building_Outlines_Import/Contributor_Guide) that can volunteers can follow, showing all scenarios
7. Run geospacial analysis on the data to merge building footprints with address data.
8. Create multiple OSM import [files](https://github.com/civicdata/louisville-buildings/tree/data-bg/osm) using a [fork of existing code](https://github.com/civicdata/louisville-buildings) from NOLA's import.
9. Contact NOLA import lead to ensure our process and data is good.
10. Create a [Task Manager](http://tasks.openstreetmap.us/job/50) job after getting OSM admin access.
11. Generate a [JSON file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/civicdata/louisville-buildings/master/blockgroups-importurl-900913.geojson) with areas of the city broken into 575 census block groups for use in Task Manager.
12. Core CDA members load some areas of the city in preparation for the event.
13. Organize, promote, and run Code Across event with our wonderful attendees!
