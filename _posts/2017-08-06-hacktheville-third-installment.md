# Eclipse Standup & Storytelling with Carto mapping at HackTheVille  

It's time to #HackTheVille, ya'll!

Join the [Civic Data Alliance](http://www.civicdataalliance.org/) and [Metro Louisville's OPI2](https://louisvilleky.gov/government/performance-improvement-innovation) for our monthly #HackTheVille night at LouieLab.

###  Eclipse Standup & Storytelling with [Carto mapping](https://carto.com) plus open call for Health data projects

Join CDA and Louisville Metro's OPI2 on the day of the total solar eclipse for an Eclipse Standup and Storytelling session with Carto. Bring your tales of what, when and where (street address and or latitude/longitude) you experienced the Eclipse to share during our standup. We will then map all those awesome stories using Carto.

We will also have space for a planning and strategy session for the upcoming Health Data/Health IoT Hackathon, and space for the basic civic hacking skills workshops available, if anyone needs help with git and Github, APIs or the like.

As always, we are extending our invite to community leaders for research and discovery sessions regarding community wants/needs.

Hope to see ya there, and please do share far and wide. #hacktheville, it's gonna be good times.

__When:__ Aug 21st, 7pm-9pm and every 3rd Monday of the month at 7pm going forward.
