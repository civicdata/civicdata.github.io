# Civic Data Alliance presents the annual National Day of Civic Hacking

##  5th Annual National Day of Civic Hacking
Join the [__Civic Data Alliance__](http://www.civicdataalliance.org/), [__Metro Louisville's OPI2__](https://louisvilleky.gov/government/performance-improvement-innovation) for the 5th Annual National Day of Civic Hacking at LouieLab and Hack for Change.

__Hack for Change Louisville__ is being held as an annual day of action to convene coders, bureaucrats, data scientists, journalists, user experience designers, and community activists to tackle big problems. This year, we’re doubling down on our cities and focusing on local challenges that Louisville faces. Privacy and safety issues local activists face online, with a focus on data security, will be one issue addressed at NDoCH, and work on our IoT voter registration project will continue.
