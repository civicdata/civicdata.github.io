__OpenStreetMap__ is built by a community of mappers that contribute and maintain data about roads, trails, cafés, railway stations, and much more, all over the world.  OpenStreetMap emphasizes local knowledge. Contributors use aerial imagery, GPS devices, and low-tech field maps to verify that OSM is accurate and up to date.

__OpenStreetMap's__ community is diverse, passionate, and growing every day. Our contributors include enthusiast mappers, GIS professionals, engineers running the OSM servers, humanitarians mapping disaster-affected areas, and many more. To learn more about the community, see the OpenStreetMap Blog, user diaries, community blogs, and the OSM Foundation website.

__OpenStreetMap is open data:__ you are free to use it for any purpose as long as you credit OpenStreetMap and its contributors. If you alter or build upon the data in certain ways, you may distribute the result only under the same licence. See the Copyright and License page for details.

### Hacktoberfest:

__Hacktoberfest Details__
We ask all participants to read through the details to ensure that the global community is working towards a shared goal. Thanks for honoring the values and following the rules of participation.

Values
As we enter our fifth year, we present the Hacktoberfest values. These have been crafted by you, the community, through your actions and stories. All we have done is highlight them.

__Participation Details__
Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community. Whether you’re a seasoned contributor or looking for projects to contribute to for the first time, you’re welcome to participate.

Pull requests can be made in any GitHub-hosted repositories/projects. As long as the project is public and GitHub-hosted, your PRs will count towards your participation

You can sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31. Just be sure to sign up on the official Hacktoberfest website for your PRs to count.

__Participation Rules__
To get a shirt, you must make five pull requests (PRs) between October 1–31 in any timezone. PRs can be to any public repo on GitHub, not just the ones highlighted. The PR must contain commits you made yourself. PRs reported by maintainers as spam or that are automated will be marked as invalid and won’t count towards the shirt. This year, the first 50,000 of you can earn a T-shirt (compared with 30,000 in 2017).
