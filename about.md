# Civic Data Alliance  
## All the Data for We the People  
The __Civic Data Alliance__ (CDA) is Louisville's [__Code for America Brigade__](http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/brigade/Civic-Data-Alliance/) and we are focused on being a force for open data, hosting hackathons, coding education, and civic engagement.

*We are the public's voice for open data, interested in liberating, improving, gathering, defining, and reporting on public data.*

### History
Louisville's Code for America Brigade was founded in December of 2012 by Michael Schnuerle after having partnered with Louisville Metro starting in 2011 to open crime, restaurant, and permit data, creating interactive maps for the city, and advising on the city's open data portal launch in October 2011.

In September 2013, the Civic Data Alliance was created by [Patrick Smith](http://citycollaborative.org/), Bret Walker, [Chris Harrell](http://www.lazarusllc.com/) and [Michael Schnuerle](http://www.yourmapper.com/) to be a community voice for liberating, improving, gathering, defining, and reporting on public data.

The CDA was merged with the Louisville CfA Brigade in May 2014 when it became a Member CfA Brigade.

In December 2014 the CDA reached official Brigade status with Code for America.
