# Civic Data Alliance
## All the Data for We the People
The __Civic Data Alliance__ (CDA) is Louisville's Civic Tech org and we are focused on advocating for inclusion, diversity, equity, accessibility, openness, transparency and accountability in government,  civic tech and open data.  

Civic Data Alliance is interested in ethically liberating, improving, gathering, defining, and reporting on public data and the state of civic tech, while fostering an inclusive and diverse civic tech community.  

We STRONGLY believe that our government should uphold and advocate for ethical principles regarding Open Data and be accountable for their Open Data practices, including the ethical collection, implementation and sharing of The People's data.
